# Overview

This simple java program was created as an exercise in learning how to use Java syntax within Visual Studio Code to prepare for work on future projects using the language. In this project, I covered the basics of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, HashMaps, reading and writing to a file to get a broad overview of Java. I will continue to add to this project as further practice and as I expand my knowledge.  

This program, 'Line Text Editor' is a simple command line text editor written in java that works with text in separate lines. It allows the user to add the inputted lines to a data structure where, with the help of the program, they can be viewed and edited. The data can then also be saved and loaded from a file for future use.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* OpenJDK 17.0.1
* Git 2.34.1.windows.1

# Useful Websites
Below are a few of the main websites I used in exploring Java syntax through Visual Studio Code.

* [Java in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java)
* [Java W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_intro.asp)
* [Java GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/)

# Future Work
A few of the features I plan on adding in the future are:

* Functionality to remove lines in the middle of the data structure
* Ability to choose files different to load and save data to
* Be able to add multiple lines at once
